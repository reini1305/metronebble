Metronebble - a Metronome for Pebble

More details (and a binary) available at http://seb.so/pebble/metronebble 

Press the select button (middle) to enter "sampling" mode - tap the pebble to set your tempo. Then press select again to get it to pulse at the tempo you've set. You can also increase/decrease the tempo with the up/down buttons.

To build, make sure you've got the Pebble SDK 2.0 setup and working, then just run
    make
or if you've setup PEBBLE_PHONE environment variable,
    make install
